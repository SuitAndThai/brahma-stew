Hello, welcome to our brahma-stew.

To run our code, open ecplipse and make sure you have no pre-existing Brahma code. i.e. BrahmaApp, BouncingBallExtension, etc. Then import our project (it's not archived so simply select existing code.) 

Run the Brahma.java file, it should pull up our GUI. It preloads all of the jar files we have written. (Sounds, BouncingBall, PersonalRecord.) The GUI should display these in a list. To run one, simply select it and hit Enter. To stop one, select it and hit Delete.

Any questions?
